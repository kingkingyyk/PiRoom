# PiRoom
Using Pi for light/fan control in my room based on motion/light/temperature readings.

*** The code is specially catered for my case.




Usage :
- Import it with Eclipse (I'm using Eclipse Neon.2 + Java 8 Update 112)
- Update the library location
- Edit the code as you like (My ADC is MCP3424, you may implement yours)
- Export as jar
- Transfer it to Raspberry Pi
- Run it as sudo java -jar <your jar name>.jar
